Road Accident Analysis using Excel

The Road Accident Analysis using Excel project is about using Excel to understand road accidents better. Road accidents are a big problem all over the world, and this project wants to help us figure out why they happen and how we can prevent them.

Excel is a great tool for analyzing data. It can handle large datasets, calculate statistics, and create charts and graphs. This project will use Excel to process road accident data and look for patterns. We will also use Excel to identify factors that contribute to accidents and explore potential solutions.

The goal of this project is to provide a data-driven approach to road accident prevention. We hope that the insights we gain from this project will help make our roads safer.

â—¯ Here are some of the specific things we will do in this project:

ðŸ”˜Collect road accident data from a variety of sources.

ðŸ”˜Clean and prepare the data for analysis.

ðŸ”˜Use Excel to analyze the data and identify patterns.

ðŸ”˜Identify factors that contribute to accidents.

ðŸ”˜Explore potential solutions to road accidents.

ðŸ”˜Create visualizations of the data to communicate our findings.

We believe that this project will make a valuable contribution to road safety. We hope that the insights we gain from this project will help policymakers and other stakeholders make informed decisions about how to make our roads safer.

â—¯ The data cleaning and processing steps I took included:

ðŸ”˜Looking for and correcting misspellings and typos.

ðŸ”˜Deleting duplicate entries.

ðŸ”˜Making sure there were no blank entries.

ðŸ”˜Making sure the units of measurement were consistent.

ðŸ”˜Grouping similar row categories together.

ðŸ”˜Adding two new features: "month" and "year", which were extracted from the "date" column.

These steps were essential to making the data ready for analysis. By cleaning and processing the data, I was able to get a more accurate and insightful understanding of the road accident data. This will help me to identify patterns and trends in the data and to develop strategies for preventing road accidents in the future.


â—¯ Important Excel features used in this dashboard are: 
ðŸ”˜Pivot tables: Pivot tables are a powerful tool for summarizing and analyzing data. They can be used to create interactive charts and graphs, which can help users quickly identify patterns and trends in the data.

ðŸ”˜Filtering: Filtering allows users to select specific data from a larger dataset. This can be useful for isolating particular trends or for focusing on specific areas of interest.

ðŸ”˜Sorting: Sorting allows users to rearrange the data in a specific order. This can be useful for comparing different values or for identifying outliers.

ðŸ”˜Charts: Charts are a great way to visualize data. They can help users to understand the data and to identify patterns and trends. The dashboard uses a variety of charts, including donut charts, line charts, tree maps, and bar charts.

ðŸ”˜Slicers: Slicers are a great way to filter data interactively. They allow users to select specific values from a data set, which will then be reflected in the charts and graphs.

ðŸ”˜Timelines: Timelines are a great way to visualize data over time. They can help users to identify trends and patterns in the data. The dashboard uses a timeline to show the number of road accidents by month.

ðŸ”˜Linking: The dashboard is linked to the datasheet, which means that any changes made to the datasheet will be reflected in the dashboard. This makes it easy to keep the dashboard up-to-date with the latest data.

â—¯ KEY INSIGHTS
By analyzing this dataset I discovered:
ðŸ”˜Total casualties were 417883 in different locations across the UK in the year 2021-2022.

ðŸ”˜Most of the casualties were caused by slight severity accidents as compared to serious and fatal severity accidents.

ðŸ”˜Highest number of casualties was caused by car accidents as compared to other vehicle types.
